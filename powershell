comments in powershell are # same as normal
a multi line comment starts with <# and ends with #>

a hearstring is a block of code that starts with @' and ends with '@, useful for running group of commands as a variable

home and end buttons take you to the start and end of the line, ctrl+ arrow key to go word by word on a line
docs.microsoft.com most helpful for looking up commands online
________________________________________________

get-executionpolicy to find execution policy on device, most of the time will be restrcited so as to not delete c:\

set-execution policy 
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -scope CurrentUser


update-"command" to update that command to the newest available according to the microsoft database
update-help -force -erroraction silentlycontinue to update our help pages without showing errors 

when using get-help if you see square brackets those are values you can set yourself, 
squigly braces means options for the command itself, (ie, for get-help set-executionpolicy the options are bypass, default, remote signed etc cetera
anything in <> is a string you can add to the cmdlet

to find examples of cmdlets or code use -examples option 
to bring up a help file on machine use -showwindow option but -online is better because most times showwindow will be outof date

get-help *tasks*
get-help task


get-command -verb or -noun or -name

helpfiles start with about_ in powershell (ie, get-help about_)


first positional parameter is -path in get-childitem 
common parameter like -name look at the object and try to get that attribute so for a parameter -name it will look at the text in -name because every object in powershell has a name


Get-ChildItem -path C:\ -filter *.evil -Recurse -Name (looks through the C directory to find all files ending in .evil recursively)
get-childitem alias:ls (finds alias for that specific command or alias entered, for us ls stands for get-childitem)
when looking at stackoverflow if a variable or thing does not make sense run get-alias "command" to find the alias
most powershell programmers are good with aliases and you arent dumbass

to create alias do New-Alias -name "dora" -value explorter.exe

new-alias -name honse -value 'Invoke-webRequest 0.4.7.7:6000:trojan.tj'
set-alias -name honse -value 'Invoke-webRequest 0.4.7.7:6000:trojan.tj' using set-alias allows for you to overwrite existing aliases where as new-alias would error out if it recognizes a previous alias was using what we wanted

to make an alias permanent we need to go to $profile (our powershell profile) 
add-content -path $profile.allusersallhosts -value "set-alias -name cat -value format-drive" 



VARIABLES
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________


$money = 'all of it' = declaration

$money = call

output = all of it

$money.GetType() = string

$somenumbs = 40
$somenumbs.GetType() = int32

typecasting

([somnumbs]$somenumbs).GetType() = somenumbs is now a string for right now
[float]
[byte]
[char]
[int]
[datetime]2022/xx/xx

$$ = last token
$! = execution status of last command, True == successful False == unsuccessful execution
$_ = current object in current pipeline
$args = array of arguments passed undeclared parameters
$input = enumeration of all parameter passed to a function
$null = variable of nothing
$true = is this true 
$false = is this false
$profile = path to the powershell profiles



$services = $(Get-Service)
get-childitem variable:* or variable:name
get-childitem $env:


ARRAYS
_________________________________________________________
how to declare arrays in powershell
$array = @()
[array]$another_array = $null
$number_array = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
$sequential_array = 1..9


finding object by index in array
$array[10] = finds object at 10th index in array $array

jagged array = array with another array in it
$nested = @,!,$array,#

Human Views as
@,
!,
1,2,3
#
$nested[2][1] = 2

string arrays is array of strings
polymorphic strings are arrays that contain multiple types of data like strings and integers and floats

.count is a valid method for arrays
$array[($array.length-1)..1] to reverse an array


HASH TABLES AND PS PROVIDERS
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

hash tables are similar to arrays but hold key value pairs, ie a dicitonary in python
how to create hash table ----> $hashtable = @{}

$ord_hash = [ordered]@{} to create a hashtable ordered the way we want

$ord_hash = [ordered]@{videogame="fortnite" ; IsTrash="yah" ; rating="1" ; working="$False"}

$ord_hash.keys
$ord_hash.values
$ord_hash[$ord_hash.keys]
$ord_hash["videogame", "IsTrash"]
$ord_hash.playerbase="preteens" to add a new keyvalue pair to ordered hash
to add a new keyvalue pair ---->$ord_hash.add("streamer" ; "hope not")

to change a value in a orderedhash use same syntax as adding a new keyvalue pair but with the key of the one you want and the text as replacing value


PS PROVIDERS = how to store and interact with an object
get-psprovider
get-psdrive

POWERSHELL PIPELINE
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
output of a powerhsell cmdlet is an object and input for next cmdlet is an object
objects have properties and methods

get-service | get-member -----> to get methods and properties
get-command -verb format

format-table, format-wide, format-custom, format-list are options to make outputs more readable

get-service | format-list to make a list of everthing to make it easier to read
get-service | sort-object -property status to sort services by running or stopped and not alphabetically 
get-service | group-object -property status to find number of processes stopped and number of processes running
get-service | Where-Object {$_.status -eq "running"} ------> shows all processes running at time
get-service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq 'running'} |Select-Object -first 10 ------> to find first 10 services that are running
get-childitem | measure-object -----> to find number of objects in current directory, use -path to specify another directory
(get-service spooler).status
^^^^^^ can use dot notation to reference objects and methods
in this instance we want the status of the spooler service


use get-member to find properties you can sort on VERY IMPORTANT
when using sort, sorting integers will be done numerically, if sorting strings it will be done by ascii


'what is the answer to life, the universe and everthing?' > test.txt
$before = Get-ChildItem

'42' > test.txt
$after = Get-ChildItem

compare-object $before $after -Property length, name

1,2,3,2,3,1,3,2,1 | sort-object | get-unique
will output 1,2,3 

important to sort first 



DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WRITE-HOST and WRITE-OUTPUT
write-host is just writing to screen and not allowing for more input 
write-ouput allows for whatever is being written to be changed and formatted to however we would like

MAKING OBJECTS IN POWERSHELL
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

$acar= New-Object Object
Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -name color -value Blue -InputObject $acar
Add-Member -Me NoteProperty -in $acar -name make -value mazda 
Add-Member -InputObject $acar noteproperty Model "RX-8" 
$acar | Add-Member noteproperty cab "8-door express van" 
Add-Member -InputObject $acar ScriptMethod Explode {"my apex seals..."}
Add-Member -InputObject $acar ScriptMethod BurnOil {"are doritos supposed to taste like this"}
Add-Member -InputObject $acar ScriptMethod Putters {"hit that granny"}

COMPARISON OPERATORS
-eq Equals
-ne Not Equal
-gt Greater Than
-lt Less Than
-ge Greater Than or Equal To
-le Less Than or Equal To
-contains Contains (used for a collection of items)
-match Matches anywhere in the string
-like Both sides of expression are identical
-in Returns true when value is contained within a collection
-replace Replaces a string pattern
-is Returns true if both objects are the same type

"abc" -eq "def"
returns true
"abc" -ne "def"
returns true

Want most specific variable or string on right side of operator otherwise powershell logic will screw up

LIKE
"inky" -like "*" ----> true
"Blinky" -like "Bl?nky" ----> true
"Pinky" -like "[L-Q]inky" ----> true
"Clyde -like [A-C]lyde" ---> true

NOT LIKE
"inky" -notlike "*" ----> true
"Blinky" -notlike "Bl?nky" ----> true
"Pinky" -notlike "[A-F]inky" ----> true
"Clyde -notlike [DEF]lyde" ---> true

MATCH

$text = "Your acount username is ACE4495"
$pattern = '([A-F]{3})(\d{4})'
$text -match $pattern

CONTAINS
$ghosts = 'inky', 'blinky', 'pinky', 'clyde'
$ghosts -contains 'blinky'

AND/OR
(($num -gt 1) -and(or) ($num -lt 10))
true

FIND A SPECIFIC NAMED PROCESS 
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.name -like 'power*'} ---> to find powershell from get-process
